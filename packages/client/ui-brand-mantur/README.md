# `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-brand-mantur`

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

This package fills the generic sidebar and blank-session hero with the approved blue infinity-loop logo, the localized `漫途Agent` product name, and the Mantur product promise. The collapsed sidebar shows the same logo until hover reveals its ordinary panel control, while the empty hero badge occupant keeps the Web Preview badge out of the Mantur composition. It changes no layout, conversation, model, permission, or agent capability.

## Use this package

Compose this row only through [`dsh-mantur-app`](../../bundle/mantur-app/README.md). The browser half registers `sidebar.brand.mark`, `sidebar.brand.name`, `conversation.hero.brand.mark`, `conversation.hero.headline`, and `conversation.hero.badge` after their owners declare them. Both locales render the confirmed product name `漫途Agent` in the sidebar, while the hero places the approved logo before the Chinese headline `故事起于一念，余下交给漫途` or its English equivalent. The Mantur Web application must serve `mantur-logo.png` beside its built page.

<a id="model-experience"></a>
## Model Experience

None, as this package contributes browser presentation only and the Mantur model identity belongs to the profile bundle.

#### KV Cache effect

None; no text from this package reaches a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **The approved source is raster artwork** — Web and native packaging use byte-identical 1024 px PNG files until Mantur approves a vector source.
- **The complete product name remains visible** — the logo supplements `漫途Agent` in the expanded sidebar instead of replacing its localized name.

### Dev Note

<details>
<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

The expanded row, collapsed rail, and hero render the same image URL. The sidebar shell owns the collapsed hover swap from the logo to its panel-navigation affordance.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. One browser effect installs and removes all five slot occupants together.
